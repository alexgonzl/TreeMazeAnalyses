Quickstart
==========

Running the algorithm
---------------------

Copy your files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you will need to create a directory (we call it ``path`` – usually you put both the date of the experiment and the name of the person doing the sorting). Your data file should have a name like ``path/mydata.extension`` 

.. warning::

    Your data should not be filtered, and by default the filtering will be done only once **onto** the data. So you need to keep a copy elsewhere of you raw data. If you really do not want to filter data on site, you can use the ``overwrite`` parameter (see :doc:`documentation on the code <../code/config>` for more information).

Generate a parameter file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the algorithm, you will always need to provide parameters, as a parameter file. Note that this parameter file has to be in the same folder than your data, and should be named ``path/mydata.params``. If you have already yours, great, just copy it in the folder. Otherwise, just launch the algorithm, and the algorithm will ask you if you want to create a template one, that you have to edit before launching the code::

    >> spyking-circus.py path/mydata.extension
    ##############################################################
    #####          Welcome to the SpyKING CIRCUS             #####
    #####                                                    #####
    #####          Written by P.Yger and O.Marre             #####
    ##############################################################
    The parameter file is not present!
    You must have a file named path/mydata.params, properly configured, 
    in the same folder, with the data file.
    Do you want SpyKING CIRCUS to create a template there? [y/n]

In the parameter file, you mostly have to change only informations in the ``data`` section (see :doc:`documentation on the code <../code/config>` for more information).

Run the algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you should run the algorithm by typing the following command(s)::

    >> spyking-circus path/mydata.extension

It should take around the time of the recording to run – maybe a bit more. The typical output of the program will be something like::


    ##################################################################

Note that you can of course change the number of CPU/GPU used, and also launch only a subset of the steps. See the help of the code to have more informations.

Using Several CPUs
------------------

To use several CPUs, you should have a proper installation of MPI, and a valid hostfile given to the program. See :doc:`documentation on MPI <../introduction/mpi>`. And then, you simply need to do, if *N* is the number of processors::

    >> spyking-circus path/mydata.extension -c N


Using the GUI
-------------

Get the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the algorithm has run on the data path/mydata.extension, you should have the following files in the directory path:

* ``path/mydata/mydata.result.hdf5``
* ``path/mydata/mydata.cluster.hdf5``
* ``path/mydata/mydata.overlap.hdf5``
* ``path/mydata/mydata.templates.hdf5``
* ``path/mydata/mydata.basis.hdf5``

See the details here see :doc:`file formats <../advanced/files>` to know more how those files are structured.

Matlab GUI
~~~~~~~~~~

To launch the MATLAB_ GUI provided with the software, you need of course to have a valid installation of MATLAB_, and you should be able to simply do::

    >> circus-gui-matlab path/mydata.extension

Python GUI
~~~~~~~~~~

An experimental GUI derived from phy_ and made especially for template-matching based algorithms can be launched by doing::


    >> spyking-circus path/mydata.extension -m converting
    >> circus-gui-python path/mydata.extension

To enable it, you must have a valid installation of phy_ and phycontrib_
