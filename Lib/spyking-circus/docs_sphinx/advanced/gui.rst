GUI without SpyKING CIRCUS
==========================

MATLAB
------

You may need to launch the MATLAB GUI on a personal laptop, where the data were not processed by the software itself, so where you only have MATLAB_ and SpyKING CIRCUS is not installed. This is feasible with the following procedure:

    * Copy the the result folder ``mydata`` on your computer
    * Create a MATLAB mapping for the probe you used, i.e. ``mapping.hdf5`` (see the following procedure below to create it)
    * Open MATLAB_
    * Set the folder ``circus/matlab_GUI`` as the default path
    * Launch the following command ``SortingGUI(sampling, 'mydata/mydata', '.mat', 'mapping.hdf5', 2)``


You just need to copy the following code snippet into a file ``generate_mapping.py``.

.. code:: python

    import sys, os, numpy, h5py

    probe_file = os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])

    def generate_matlab_mapping(probe):
        p         = {}
        positions = []
        nodes     = []
        for key in probe['channel_groups'].keys():
            p.update(probe['channel_groups'][key]['geometry'])
            nodes     +=  probe['channel_groups'][key]['channels']
            positions += [p[channel] for channel in probe['channel_groups'][key]['channels']]
        idx       = numpy.argsort(nodes)
        positions = numpy.array(positions)[idx]

        t     = "mapping.hdf5"
        cfile = h5py.File(t, 'w')
        to_write = {'positions' : positions/10., 'permutation' : numpy.sort(nodes), 'nb_total' : numpy.array([probe['total_nb_channels']])}
        for key in ['positions', 'permutation', 'nb_total']:
            cfile.create_dataset(key, data=to_write[key])
        cfile.close()
        return t

    probe = {}
    with open(probe_file, 'r') as f:
        probetext = f.read()
        exec probetext in probe

    mapping = generate_matlab_mapping(probe)


And then simply launch::

    >> python generate_mapping.py yourprobe.prb

Once this is done, you should see a file ``mapping.hdf5`` in the directory where you launch the command. This is the MATLAB_ mapping.

.. note::
    
    If you do not have ``h5py`` installed on your machine, launch this script on the machine where SpyKING CIRCUS has been launched

After the ``converting`` step, you must have a folder ``mydata/mydata.GUI``. You simply need to copy this folder onto a computer without SpyKING CIRCUS, but only phy_. Then you just need to copy the following code snippet into a file ``phy_launcher.py``.


.. code:: python    
    
    from phy import add_default_handler
    from phy.utils._misc import _read_python
    from phy.gui import create_app, run_app
    from phycontrib.template import TemplateController
    
    gui_params                   = {}
    gui_params['dat_path']       = DATAPATH
    gui_params['dir_path']       = DATAPATH/DATAPATH.GUI #If data are left in the directory created by SpyKING CIRCUS (where are the .npy)
    gui_params['n_channels_dat'] = TOTAL_NB_CHANNELS
    gui_params['n_features_per_channel'] = 5
    gui_params['dtype']          = DATATYPE
    gui_params['offset']         = DATA_OFFSET
    gui_params['sample_rate']    = SAMPLE_RATE
    gui_params['hp_filtered']    = True

    create_app()
    controller = TemplateController(**gui_params)
    gui = controller.create_gui()

    gui.show()
    run_app()
    gui.close()
    del gui



You need to edit the appropriate values in capital letters, and then simply copy it into the folder where the raw data are. Now you can do::

    >> python phy_launcher.py


One other option is to simply create a ``params.py`` file

.. code:: python

    dat_path       = DATAPATH
    dir_path       = DATAPATH/DATAPATH.GUI #If data are left in the directory created by SpyKING CIRCUS (where are the .npy)
    n_channels_dat = TOTAL_NB_CHANNELS
    n_features_per_channel = 5
    dtype          = DATATYPE
    offset         = DATA_OFFSET
    sample_rate    = SAMPLE_RATE
    hp_filtered    = True

Then copy this file into the folder where the raw data are and launch::
    
    >> phy template-gui params.py


If the raw data are not found, the Traceview will not be displayed. If you really want to see that view, remember that you need to get the raw data **filtered**, so  you must also copy them back from your sorting machine.
